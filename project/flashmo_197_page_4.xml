<p align="justify">MSRIT presents the annual cultural fest<span class="highlight">UDBHAV THE VTU FEST</span>.  Every college has its spirit, <span class="highlight">its expectedly ubiquitous slogans</span>. and their student sentinels. Such spirit gives life to the concept of college as a place not of study alone, but that of a society. However, the chutzpah of MSRIT, Bangalore explodes perfectly unhindered at Udbhav, the official intra-collegiate fest of MSRIT. In the academic year, that is largely uninspired monochromatic drudgery, the single point of exhilarating artistic freedom is this 3-day fest. </p>

<span class="subtitle">About the fest</span>
<p align="justify">Comprising of around 42 events of all genre, Udbhav gives the 5000-odd student population of MSRIT abundant opportunity to showcase its talents, however amateur. In keeping with the sheer fun-ness of the fest, each day, according to tradition, has themes for student attire, like Ethnic Day, Wear Your Music Day etc. Udbhav is organized entirely by the students headed by student committee and volunteers, selected by democratic screening methods.</p>

<span class="subtitle">About the student</span>
<p align="justify"> Essentially the fest also functions as preliminary audition and selection of participants to represent the college at the much awaited annual VTU Cultural Fest. The excitement for Udbhav begins, like its preparation, months ahead of its actual arrival and lingers for a long time after. MSRIT is fortunate to have a management that allows the students to design a cultural fest of this scale, which allows the students a satisfying breather in the middle of every year.</p>
