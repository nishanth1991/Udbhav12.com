Website developed for the 12th Annual Youth Cultural Festival 

3 parts if you are looking at the repository. 

The project part contains the actual webiste which went live. All the flash components and respective images. Please use the index file to keep everything running in order.

The registration folder contains the database part which I majorly worked on. A database with a table explaning the initial college list is required. As each college logins in for the first time, a new table is created. Connection will be timed out after 3600 seconds.

The vt(Virtual Tour) is the result of application of image stitching algorithms to provide a panaromic view of the college. Feel free to browse it and any feedback would be appreciated. 


Note: All parts of the code are free to use. Please contact me if you have difficulty with anything.
